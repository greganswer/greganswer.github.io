## Quotes

- An experienced engineer can take a single-sentence summary and build a whole system
- Any project that takes longer than a week is at risk
- With software, it's better to build something and turn if off than to talk about building something
- With Pomodoros, I know exactly how much time I wasted on what
- By listing weekly priorities during busy times, it's like there's a storm outside, yet my house is water and sound proof
