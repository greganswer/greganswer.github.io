I skimmed through dozens of newsletters this week. Here’s some interesting articles I found.

## [Let It Fail](https://www.maxcountryman.com/articles/let-it-fail?utm_source=techleaddigest&utm_medium&utm_campaign=1547)

What a scary title but an insightful article

- Sometimes you have to let systems fail (in a controlled way) in order for people to understand why that system needs more attention (see it to believe it)
- I’d like to add, sometimes systems either don’t fail in the way you anticipate or they fail without major issue. Either way you’ve learned something
- Back pressure is a way to prevent systems (and individuals) from getting overwhelmed and failing by limiting their workload and improving efficiency
- If someone becomes “the hero” and tries to fix everything, they become the single point of failure

## [Should the moon have its own time zone?](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/moon-time-zone-rcna72459)

- Every software engineer *loves* timezones. Why not add one for the moon?
- Actually, it may be necessary for communication between astronauts and various countries
- The European Space Agency proposes a standard time zone for the moon to ease collaboration
- Lunar timekeeping is challenging due to tiny shifts in clock speeds and location variations

## [Be careful what you type when importing packages](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/451-malicious-packages-available-in-pypi-contained-crypto-stealing-malware/)

- Attackers upload packages with common typos (known as typosquatting)
- These packages contain malware
- This malware is executed unbeknownst to engineers
- This has been happening for years but the code obfuscations are getting more sophisticated
