Since I started this blog, I’ve realized the importance of writing. Engineers more senior than me have noted that writing is:

1. **The most effective asynchronous communication.** You can read on any device, skim to what you want, highlight things, copy and paste into other mediums, etc.
2. **Excellent for self reflection.** Anyone can come back to this and review it later to see how the person or topic has progressed.
3. **Easily modified with new info.** Video has to be recorded, edited, and spliced in. This could cause a choppy viewer/listener experience.

People think that you have to spend a tremendous amount of time writing. I only write when I have something to write about.

As I write this, I’m staring at 20 minute pomodoro clock on my desk that says 12:49 seconds remaining. I wrote a paragraph for a different post before writing for this post. I jump around as my thoughts jump around. I have at least 5 red squiggly lines right now.

Once my thoughts or the pomodoro is done (whichever comes first), I’ll re-read and edit this for about 10 minutes then I’ll hit the “publish” button on whatever platform I'm using.

20-60 minutes per week. That’s it. No fuss. This is sustainable for me.

**Anyone who reads this in the future is going to spend a fraction of the time reading it so why waste more time for less benefit?** Consider this for everything you work on.
