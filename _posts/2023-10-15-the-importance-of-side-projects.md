I don't know where to start this post. I just know that side projects are really important. Underrated even. I do them whenever I'm curious or when I want to strengthen my knowledge in one area. I've taken them for granted.

Many engineers I've spoken with don't really invest in side projects. Whenever I show them something cool that I did, they ask *"Where did you learn that?"* Side projects.

If you're hoping to learn everything you need on the job, keep hoping. Companies need you to get things done, not to spend time learning. Learning is definitely a bonus. If you're lucky enough to work at a company that emphasizes learning, congratulations. For everyone else, you need side projects.

Side projects range from courses and books to full applications that you may intend to offer as a service. Whether your goal is to make money or just to learn, your side project will stretch you in ways you never thought possible.

### Advantages

Below I will list some of the many advantages of side projects.

- **Learning and relearning.** There are so many engineering principles that we don't practice regularly. A recent side project I worked on reminded me of the importance of specifications and ensuring the components you select meet the minimum criteria.
- **Practice.** Struggling to learn a tool or technique? Build a side project that forces you to practice this repeatedly.
- **Sharing and teaching others.** If someone asks you, *"How do I work with XYZ?"* it be great to reply, *"Checkout this side projects I have on GitHub."*
- **Getting better at your job.** As I mentioned previously, many of the skills I have are from practicing on side projects, where I have time and the outcome doesn't really matter.
- **Provide insights and tools for your job.** At every company I've worked at, I've added at least one tool that improves the workflow of many people. These all started as side projects I was curious about.
- **Satisfaction of completing something, even if no one uses it.** As engineers, we should strive to build things which give us a sense of accomplishment, even if that only happens outside of work hours.
- **Faster feedback.** Lessons that take six months to learn on the job can take six days to learn in a side project.

### Examples

Now that you know some of the advantages, you might be thinking, *"How do I get started?"* You probably don't want to build another boring "TODO App" right? Here's a short list of meaningful side projects.

- **Rewrite exiting internal code.** Take a module or project from your company and try to rewrite it in your own way. Of course, be careful not to leak intellectual property.
- **Rewrite exiting external code.** System Design courses and books often ask you design Rate Limiters, Instant Messaging, Video Streaming, etc. You might focus on the high level design or just a single module.
- **Build a new tool.** Tired of Jira admin for your Merge Requests? Build a [workflow CLI](https://github.com/greganswer/laptop/tree/master/workflow) and share it with your friends.
- **Build a new app.** One the first apps I built and rebuilt many times is [Qwiz Notes](https://github.com/greganswer/qwiznotes), a social network for students to study. This is long before the AI explosion but this app taught me how to build whole projects by myself.

### Conclusion

These are just some of the examples and advantages of side projects. I understand that this may seem overwhelming but you don't need more than 10 hours a week to get the benefits. You just have to be disciplined and remember why you're doing this. If you don't have discipline or a goal, then none of the above matters.

Remember to keep it fun and engaging. Feed your inner child with playfulness and curiosity. These 2 things will take you further than you can imagine.
