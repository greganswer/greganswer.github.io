This one is totally worth reading and remembering. Exceptional Engineers:

1. Are ambitious and determined (crave feedback and new challenges)
2. Habitually simplify (working simple code that's easy to maintain)
3. Can debug anything quickly (the quicker you can fix, the more time you can spend building value)
