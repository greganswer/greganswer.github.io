I skimmed through dozens of newsletters this week. Here’s some interesting articles I found.

**NOTE:** Just because you read my summary doesn’t mean you understand the full point of original author. I recommend you read the full article if it’s for a topic that you feel is impactful to you.

## [Atomic Habits Visualized](https://twitter.com/nalband/status/1631338158976638976) (Twitter thread)

- Atomic Habits by James Clear is a great book that talks about how to make good habits so that you can achieve your goals
- Each completion of a good habit is [a “vote” for the person you want to become](https://twitter.com/nalband/status/1631338358453542917)
- [The best work comes from focusing on quantity](https://twitter.com/nalband/status/1631338447792218125)
- Though I have not finished the book, the visuals in this Twitter thread are pretty good

## [A very nerdy perspective on naming things in programming](https://makimo.pl/blog/scientific-perspective-on-naming-in-programming) (16 mins read)

- My takeaway: Code should read like English (as much as possible, language dependent)
- I skimmed through it but I will also read it slowly because this is important for long term code readability

## [Data centers at public pools keep swimmers warm](https://www.theverge.com/23641207/data-center-pools-united-kingdom-energy-cost-saving) (1 min read)

- A tech firm is setting up its small data centers at public pools across the UK
- Data centers need to cool down, pools need to heat up
- The generated heat from the servers heats up the pool at a lower cost
- This is a great example of what I like to call “Feed 2 birds, with 1 worm”
- I hope no one has to open up the server to chain a hard drive anytime soon!

## [Advanced interview questions for a Ruby developer](https://medium.com/@real_wyodeb/advanced-interview-questions-for-a-ruby-developer-65ba774c2ca9)

- Here’s a short quiz of advanced Ruby topics
- I got about 9 out of 14 correct. Some questions are a bit more open ended and my answer was different.
- I ran into [Ruby super( )]({% post_url  2023-03-07-ruby-super-annoying-ruby-still-awesome %}) again!
- I learned a bit about garbage collection in Ruby

## [Mini Robot Enters Blood Vessels, Completes Surgery](https://spectrum.ieee.org/mini-robot-surgeon) (1 min read)

- A team of engineers in South Korea created robotically assisted magnetic navigation system for endovascular intervention (I-RAMAN)
- A magnetic robot can use a 3D map of the patient’s blood vessels to navigate autonomously and perform treatments
- I think this is really cool and I love to see technology like this saving lives
