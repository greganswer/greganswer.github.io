I was talking to some teammates about leadership and I mentioned that most of my leadership strategies are directly influenced by Star Trek. I’ve watched a lot of Star Trek. I’ve definitely watched all the movies. Some more than once. The “problem” is every time I finish a TV series, they come out with a new one. Or a new two. Or a new animated series.

What I love about “good” Star Trek is that it’s more than just Science Fiction. “Good” is subjective of course and this influences why I’m no longer trying to watch ALL of Star Trek. “Good” Star Trek is about Philosophy and Leadership. Some of my favorite episodes revolve around “the situation is life and death so how to do handle this safely and diplomatically?” Yes, this is all fiction, but the way a character handles situations says a lot about their “beliefs” and how they will handle similar situations in the future.

Star Trek has taught me diplomacy. Star Trek has shown me how to standup for what’s right, with the right amount of aggression. Star Trek regularly demonstrates how “alien” cultures can work side-by-side for a common goal of peace and exploration. Star Trek is the future I want to live in. I’ve watched and rewatched hundreds of episodes across multiple series and I never fail to learn or appreciate something.

If you’re ready to nerd out and spend several hours truly embracing the Philosophy and Leadership, I recommend the seven seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation TV series (1987-1994). If you’re short on time and just want a high level of what I’m talking about, I recommend the first season of Star Trek: Strange New Worlds (2022-present). Be mindful of the time periods when these were released and not every episode is “good”.

Though I would never risk my life to go to space in my lifetime, there will come a time when people will do this regularly. As regularly as many cross the ocean by boat or plane. In the meantime, I will continue to watch and rewatch Star Trek while I dream of the infinite possibilities.
